## 🎯 Objective

To demonstrate how Power BI dashboards can transform medical claims data into actionable insights by analyzing claims, denials, financial performance, and procedure costs — enabling healthcare organizations to improve efficiency, reduce revenue leakage, and make informed decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview (About the Client)

The client is a healthcare provider managing a large volume of claims across multiple insurance types. They struggled to track claim statuses, understand denial trends, and monitor reimbursement rates efficiently. Their goal was to gain end-to-end visibility of claims data and improve revenue cycle management.

## ⚠️ Challenge

Fragmented and siloed claims data spread across systems.

Difficulty in identifying top denial reasons and recurring claim issues.

Lack of visibility into financial performance — billed vs. paid amounts and reimbursement rates.

Limited insights into the cost impact of procedures and their utilization.

Time-consuming manual reporting, leaving little room for strategic planning.

## 💡 Solution

I developed an interactive Medical Claim Analysis Dashboard in Power BI with multiple reporting layers:

Claim Report – Overview of total claims, status breakdown (paid, denied, under review), and insurance type trends.

Denial Analysis Report – Identification of denial reasons, denial rates by insurance type, and month-wise denial trends.

Financial Performance Report – Detailed tracking of billed, allowed, and paid amounts with reimbursement rate analysis.

Procedure Analysis Report – Insights into top procedures by billed amount, utilization, and reimbursement impact.
